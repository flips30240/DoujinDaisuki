JPG or PNG file type only for all images (many browsers do not support other extensios)

I decided on using html as the property file type, its easier and faster than parsing through a text file. Refer to the example (1) in collections

I'm going to have to use php on the server side to read through all the directories and send the info to the client side javascript.
